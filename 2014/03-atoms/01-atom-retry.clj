;; The output of this program is:
;;
;;   â†’ clj 01-atom-retry.clj
;;   Incrementing 0 very slowly...
;;   Incrementing 0 slowly...
;;   Incrementing 1 very slowly...
;;   The final value: 2
;;
;; The first update gets retried, because the atom got changed by slow-inc while
;; very-slow-inc was running. The final result is consistent - it is 2, because
;; two increments were invoked.
