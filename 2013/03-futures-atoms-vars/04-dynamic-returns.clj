;;; This program illustrates how to use dynamic scoping to return arguments.
;;; The abs function can indicate whether it had to flip the sign of its
;;; argument or not. The caller can check *negative-arg* after calling abs.
;;;
;;; A caveat of this code is that it would result to an error if the caller has
;;; not bound *negative-arg*. Fixing this (with thread-bound?) is left as an
;;; exercise to the reader.
